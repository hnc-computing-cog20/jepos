This is an EPoS system I made for class. Enjoy.
In order to use it you will need the database. It's an SQLite3 database and
should come with everything else, but if it doesn't then you need to create
3 tables: staff, orders, and inventory.

Database schema as follows...

CREATE TABLE staff
(
id smallint primary key not null,
firstname varchar(20),
surname varchar(20),
username varchar(23),
password varchar(16),
role smallint
);

CREATE TABLE orders
(
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
handler VARCHAR(20),
items TEXT,
date INTEGER
);

CREATE TABLE inventory
(
id INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
name VARCHAR(30),
price REAL
);
